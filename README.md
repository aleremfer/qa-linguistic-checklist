# QA Linguistic Checklist

This repository includes an internal QA checklist for reviewing multilingual AI-generated content.

The checklist is designed to help reviewers and annotators assess:
- Clarity and fluency in each target language
- Accuracy and naturalness of translations
- Consistency in tone, formatting, and terminology
- Absence of hallucinations, bias, or cultural insensitivity
- Proper handling of inclusive, respectful, and localized language

ðŸ“Œ Focused on English and Spanish for now, but adaptable to other languages.

âœ… Useful in LLM evaluation pipelines, prompt testing, localization QA, or internal review tasks.

ðŸ“„ A downloadable QA template will be added soon.
